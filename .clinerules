Please write all code and comments in English. I might give instructions in Japanese,
but please make sure the code is in English.

If the code you load contains Japanese, please actively modifies it to translate it into English.

Also, don't add unnecessary comments.
Only comment on things that aren't clear from the code itself.

You'll be working with TypeScript code, and all code should follow React principles.
Especially, if you can avoid full re-renders by managing state effectively, please do so.

Also, aim for UI styling that is polished and consistent.
Write CSS in [`styles.css`](./styles.css).
Refer to the styles of other components to ensure consistent styling.
