# Tasks Calendar

Tasks Calendar is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that leverages [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) to visualize tasks on an interactive calendar. By integrating with the [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin, it automatically gathers tasks from your notes and presents them in a flexible, easy-to-manage interface.

## Supported Task Formats

- Supports tasks defined with basic dates:
  ```
  - [ ] Task description [due:: YYYY-MM-DD]
  ```
- Supports multi-day tasks:
  ```
  - [ ] Task description [start:: YYYY-MM-DD] [due:: YYYY-MM-DD]
  ```
- Supports tasks with specific date and time:
  ```
  - [ ] Task description [due:: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm]
  ```

That's it. You are free to write your tasks wherever you want.

### Comparison with obsidian-full-calendar

[obsidian-full-calendar](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-full-calendar) is a similar plugin that also uses the FullCalendar library. The key difference is in how tasks are managed:

|  | Tasks Calendar | obsidian-full-calendar |
|--|---------------|---------------|
| **Task Storage** | Tasks can be written anywhere in your vault | One note per task approach |
| **Task Discovery** | Uses Dataview to scan and aggregate tasks | Relies on dedicated note properties |
| **Philosophy** | Freedom to organize tasks in any note structure | Structured approach with dedicated notes |

### Compatibility with Tasks Plugin

Tasks Calendar works seamlessly with the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin as both share similar philosophies for task management:

- Both allow tasks to be written anywhere in your vault
- Both scan your vault to gather and display tasks
- Use Tasks for powerful task filtering and management
- Use Tasks Calendar for visual calendar representation and simple task management

### Feature Parity Note

Tasks Calendar is not intended to be a direct replacement for obsidian-full-calendar.
Certain obsidian-full-calendar features (like Google Calendar integration) may or may not be added in the future.
