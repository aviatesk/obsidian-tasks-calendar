## [0.1.1]
### Added
- Supports file property tasks (using frontmatter):
  ```yaml
  ---
  ...
  due: YYYY-MM-DD
  start: YYYY-MM-DD  # Optional for multi-day tasks
  status: " " # optional, empty string means this task is "Incomplete"
  ...
  ---
  ```
  The file name becomes the task title, and the entire note becomes a task.
